\title{Create plot data for visualization of clustering results}
\usage{
create_plot_data(data, rhs_formula, cluster_labels, meanPS)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame of the original covariates used for clustering.}

\item{rhs_formula}{A one-sided formula object specifying which covariates
were used in the propensity‚Äêscore model (e.g. \code{~ x1 + x2 + factor1}).}

\item{cluster_labels}{An integer vector or factor of cluster assignments
for each observation (as returned by \code{propensity_score_clustering()}).}

\item{meanPS}{Numeric vector of mean propensity scores for each observation.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{data}{A data.frame with columns \code{PC1}, \code{PC2}, \code{Cluster} (factor),
and \code{MeanPS}, ready for plotting.}
\item{pca_result}{The full \code{prcomp} object, in case you want custom charts.}
